# Lab 2 Task

In this task, the students are being introduced to the concept of creating and using classes. Along with that, OOP concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism are also being presented. 

The students have to create an abstract `Shape` class. The class will have an abstract method that returns the area of the shape. Once this is done, three more classes, namely, the `Circle`, `Square` and `Triangle` classes, will be created. All these classes will inherit the `Shape` class and will have fields to accommodate the values required to calculate  area (e.g. for `Circle`, radius will be stored as an attribute). 

Once all the classes are created, an array of `Shape` will be initialized containing three shapes. One of each of the concrete shapes will be assigned to the array. Using a `for` loop, the areas of all the shapes will be displayed.
